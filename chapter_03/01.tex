\begin{exercise}[]{Unstructured Contextual Bandits}
\end{exercise}
Consider a contextual bandit problem with a finite set $\X$ of possible contexts, 
and a finite set of actions $\A.$
Show that running UCB independently for each context yields a regret bound of the order $\wt \OO(\sqrt{|\X||\A|T})$ in expectation, ignoring logarithmic factors.
In the setting where $\F = \X \times \A \to [0, 1]$ is unstructured, and consists of all possible functions, this is essentially optimal.
