\begin{exercise}[]{Model Misspecification in Contextual Bandits}
\end{exercise}
In Proposition 10, we showed that for contextual bandits with a general class $\F$,
 SquareCB attains regret
 \[ \Reg \lesssim \sqrt{AT \EstSq(\F,T,\delta)}.\]

 To do so, we assumed that $f^* \in \F$, where 
 $f^*(x,a) := \EEs{r}{r\sim M^*(\cdot|x,a)}$; that is, we have a well- specified model. 
 In practice, it may be unreasonable to assume that we have $f^* \in \F.$
 Instead, a weaker assumption is that there exists some function $\bar f \in \F$ such that
 \[ \max_{x \in \X, a \in \A} |\bar f(x,a)-f^*(x,a)|\leq \epsilon\]
 for some $\epsilon >0$; that is, the model is $\epsilon$-\textit{misspecified}. In this problem,
 we will generalize the regret bound for SquareCB to handle misspecification. Recall that in the lecture notes, we assumed
 that the regression oracle satisfies
 \[ \sum_{t=1}^T \EEs{(\wh f^t(x^t,\pi^t)-f^*(x^t,\pi^t))^2}{\pi^t \sim p^t}\leq \EstSq(\F,T,\delta).\]
 In the misspecified setting, this is too much to ask for. 
 Instead, we will assume that the oracle satisfies the following guarantee for every sequence:
\[ \sum_{t=1}^T(\wh f^t(x^t,\pi^t)-r^t)^2 -\min_{f\in \F}\sum_{t=1}^T(f(x^t,\pi^t)-r^t)^2\leq \Reg_{\text{Sq}}(\F,T).\]
Whenever $f^* \in \F$, we have $\EstSq(\F,T,\delta)\lesssim \Reg_{\text{Sq}}(\F,T)+ \log(1/\delta)$ with probability at least $1-\delta$.
However, it is possible to keep $\Reg_{\text{Sq}}(\F,T)$ small even when $f^* \notin \F$.
For example, the averaged exponential weights algorithm satisfies this guarantee with 
$\Reg_{\text{Sq}} \lesssim \log |\F|$, regardless of whether $f^* \in \F.$

We will show that for every $\delta > 0$, with an appropriate choice of $\gamma$, SquareCB (that is, the algorithm that chooses $p^t =\textbf{IGW}_\gamma(\wh f^t(x^t,\cdot))$ 
ensures that with probability at least $1-\delta$,
\[ \Reg \lesssim \sqrt{AT (\Reg_{\text{Sq}}(\F,T)+\log(1/\delta))} +\epsilon A^{1/2}T.\]

1.  Show that for any sequence of estimators 
$\wh f^1 ,\ldots,\wh f^t,$ by choosing $p_t = \textbf{IGW}_\gamma(\wh f^t(x^t , \cdot))$, we have that
\[\Reg= \sum_{t=1}^T \EEs{f^*(x^t,\pi^*(x^t))}{\pi^t\sim p^t} \lesssim \frac{AT}{\gamma}+ \gamma \sum_{t=1}^T
\EEs{(\wh f^t(x^t,\pi^t)-\bar f(x^t,\pi^t))^2}{\pi^t \sim p^t}+\epsilon T.\]

2. Show that the following inequality holds for every sequence
\[ \sum_{t=1}^T(\wh f^t(x^t,\pi^t)-\bar f(x^t,\pi^t))^2\leq \Reg_{\text{Sq}}(\F,T)+2\sum_{t=1}^T(r^t-\bar f(x^t,\pi^t))(\wh f^t(x^t,\pi^t)-\bar f(x^t,\pi^t)).\]
3. Using Freedman’s inequality (Lemma 35), show that with probability at least $1-\delta$,
\[\sum_{t=1}^T \EEs{(\wh f^t (x^t,\pi^t)-\bar f(x^t,\pi^t))^2}{\pi^t \sim p^t} \leq 2\sum_{t=1}^T(\wh f^t (x^t, \pi^t)-\bar f (x^t,\pi^t))^2 + \OO(\log(1/delta)).\]

4. Using Freedman’s inequality once more, show that with probability at least $1-\delta$;
\[ 2\sum_{t=1}^T (r^t-\bar f(x^t,\pi^t)(\wh f^t(x^t,\pi^t)-\bar f(x^t,\pi^t))\leq \frac{1}{4}\sum_{t=1}^T \EEs{(\wh f^t(x^t,\pi^t)-\bar f(x^t,\pi^t))^2}{\pi^t \sim p^t}  + \OO(\epsilon^2 T + \log(1/\delta)).\]
Conclude that with probability at least $1-\delta$,
\[ \sum_{t=1}^T \EEs{(\wh f^t(x^t,\pi^t)- \bar f(x^t,\pi^t))^2}{\pi^t \sim p^t} \lesssim \Reg_{\text{Sq}(\F,T)}+ \epsilon^2T+\log(1/\delta).\]

5. Combining the previous results, show that for any $\delta > 0$,
 by choosing $\gamma > 0$ appropriately, we have that with probability at least $1-\delta$,

 \[ \Reg \lesssim \sqrt{AT(\Reg_{\text{Sq}}(\F,T)+\log(1/\delta))} +\epsilon A^{1/2}T.  \]
